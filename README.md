# PodSubspecDependencyIssue

## Description

This sample podspec has been created to help resolve a cocoapod github issue. It illustrates a problem I've encountered creating private Cocoapods with Cocoapods 0.39, when the created Cocoapod depends on a 3rd party pod subspec.

The example subspec which seems to present the problem here is 'AWSiOSSDKv2/DynamoDB'
