# PodSubspecDependencyIssue

## Description

This sample podspec has been created to help resolve a CocoaPod github issue. It illustrates a problem I've encountered creating private pods when using CocoaPods 0.39 and XCode 7. The problem seem to manifest when the pod depends on a 3rd party pod subspec.

The example subspec which seems to present the problem 'AWSiOSSDKv2/DynamoDB'
